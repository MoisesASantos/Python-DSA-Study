We now have two sorting algorithms on our LockedIn backend! It is a bit annoying to maintain both in the codebase. Quicksort is fast on large datasets just like merge sort, but is also lighter on memory usage. Let's use quick sort for both follower count and influencer revenue sorting!

Complete the quick_sort and partition functions according to the given algorithms.

def quick_sort(nums, low, high):
    if low < high:
        middle = partition(nums, low, high)
        quick_sort(nums, low, middle - 1)
        quick_sort(nums, middle + 1, high)
    return nums

def partition(nums, low, high):
    pivot = nums[high]
    i = low - 1
    for j in range(low, high):
        if nums[j] < pivot:
            i += 1
            nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
    nums[i + 1], nums[high] = nums[high], nums[i + 1]
    return i + 1
